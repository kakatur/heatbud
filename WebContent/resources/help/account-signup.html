Signing up with Heatbud has advantages even if you don't write posts.<br>
<br>
(1) Read posts - If you're logged-in, your reading list is maintained in each zone. Our software delivers only the top posts in each zone and makes sure that you won't read the same posts unless you traverse backwards in a zone.
<br>
(2) Favorite zones - You can access your favorite zones easily.
<br>
(3) Comment - Express yourself. Give the blogger constructive criticism.
<br>
(4) Vote - You may Up vote or Down vote a post.<br>
<br>
Moreover, signing up is FREE and Easy! There are two ways to <a href="/do/login">signup</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>1. Using Heatbud</b><br>
<br>
Simply fill out the one-step registration form on the login page and click "sign up".<br>
<br>
For your security, we will send an "Email Verification Request". Though we send this email instantly, sometimes it may take a while for it to be delivered to your Inbox. If you don't find it in your Inbox, check your Junk folder and click "Not Junk" or "Not Spam" to move it to your Inbox.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Using Facebook</b><br>
<br>
It is even easier to sign up using your Facebook account. We transfer all needed information from Facebook, so all you need to input is your new password for Heatbud.<br>
<br>
Please note that we read your Facebook data only once. If you update your information later on Facebook, it won't be automatically reflected on Heatbud.<br>
