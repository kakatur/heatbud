<br>
Explore the features of our Blog Post Editor and try all of them before publishing your post.<br>
<br>
<b>Fonts</b><br>
<br>
To make your posts look impressive, we made several fonts available. Try all the fonts before choosing the ones best suited for your post.<br>
<br>
<b>Images</b><br>
<br>
Click the "Image" icon and choose one of the following ways to add images to your post.<br>
<ul style="list-style-type:decimal">
<li>If the images are somewhere on the Internet, type the entire URL that starts with https://</li>
<li>If the images are on your desktop, click "Browse Server" where you can upload and organize your images on Heatbud.</li>
</ul>
Notes:<br>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Make sure to resize the images so they align cleanly with your content.</li>
<li>If you use an external URL, make sure it starts with "https://" or else your image will not display.</li>
<li>Don't delete the images that are inserted into your posts. Doing so will result in your post not displaying correctly.</li>
</ul>
<b>Tables</b><br>
<br>
Tables are used to organize data. They are also useful for inserting text and images in a multi-column layout. Experiment with tables and see how you can benefit from them.<br>
<br>
You may make the table borders invisible after arranging your content.<br>
<br>
<b>Links</b><br>
<br>
Refer external websites using links. Note that links open in a separate tab.<br>
<br>
<b>Spell Check</b><br>
<br>
Words are spell-checked as you type. For Title and Summary, use "Right Click" to view suggestions. For Content, use "CTRL+Right Click".<br>
<br>
<b>Copy from Word</b><br>
<br>
If you want to use your favorite word processor to edit your post, you may do so. Once the post is edited, you may simply copy and paste the content into the Heatbud editor window.<br>
<br>
<b>Preview</b><br>
<br>
The preview button displays what your finished post will look like.<br>
<br>
<b>This is just the beginning!</b><br>
