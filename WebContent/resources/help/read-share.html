When you find a nice post, you may want to share it with your friends.<br>
<br>
<b>Send by Email</b><br>
<br>
You can send a Post URL by email to a list of recipients. You can include an optional personal message in the email.<br>
<br>
*** Spamming is discouraged by Heatbud. We store your IP address and email address to report to bloggerities if needed. ***<br>
<br>
<b>Share on Facebook</b><br>
<br>
You can share a post on Facebook with one click. You can enter an optional message that will be posted on your Facebook account. Heatbud doesn't have control on this message.<br>
<br>
<b>Share Elsewhere</b><br>
<br>
Use the URL from the pop up window or from the address bar. Most applications extract the image and title of the post automatically.<br>
