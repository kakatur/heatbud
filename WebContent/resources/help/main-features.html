<div class="helpSub">Top Features of Heatbud</div>
<br/>
Unlike traditional blogging sites, Heatbud has been designed from the ground up with a strong focus on Social features. Here are some of them:<br>
<br>
<b>Zone</b><br>
<br>
The core social feature of Heatbud that makes collaboration happen. Every other function of Heatbud revolves around the Zone.<br>
<br>
Some zones are time-bound and some eternal. Some are limited to a particular region and some global. But all zones are powerful entities that facilitate a targeted discussion.<br>
<br>
<b>Reading List</b><br>
<br>
Heatbud's proprietary algorithm that picks the "top" among the "unread posts in a zone" as your next post. Let's say there are 10 posts in a zone and you have read 2 of them. When you click next, we pick the best among the remaining 8 posts and present it as your next post.<br>
<br>
The purpose of the Reading List is to ensure that you will be reading the best posts as you traverse through the zone.<br>
<br>
Reading List is completely transparent to users and it is automatically maintained by Heatbud.<br>
