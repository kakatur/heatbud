<div class="helpSub">Explore Zones</div>
Creating and managing your own blog on a traditional blogging website is very challenging. With all that effort, you will hardly see any hits on your posts.<br>
<br>
<b>Introducing Zones</b><br>
<br>
We invented the concept of Zones where collaboration happens naturally. Zones are easy to create, require virtually no maintenance and result in ever-lasting conversations.<br>
<br>
<b>Enter a Zone</b><br>
<br>
You will enter a zone when you click on a post title or a zone name from the Top Charts or from the Search Results.<br>
<br>
Within a zone, the posts are sorted by the Heat Index. You can traverse forward or backward to read the posts in a zone.<br>
<br>
<b>Top Zones</b><br>
<br>
The Top Zones section displays Heatbud zones ranked by their current popularity.<br>
<br>
<b>My Zones</b><br>
<br>
If you are logged-in, your favorite Zones appear under <a href="/do/help/account/zones">My Zones</a>.<br>.
