<div class="helpSub">What is Heat Index?</div>
Heat Index is a statistic that represents the popularity of a Zone, Post or Blogger. Heatbud uses a proprietary formula to derive the Heat Index.<br>
<br>
<b>Posts</b><br>
<br>
Each published post increases the Heat Index of the zone by 10. The Heat Index decreases if the post is unpublished.<br>
<br>
<b>Views</b><br>
<br>
Each unique view increases the Heat Index of the Zone, Post and Blogger by 1.<br>
<br>
<b>Votes</b><br>
<br>
Each UpVote increases the Heat Index of the Zone, Post and the Blogger by 2. Each DownVote decreases the Heat Index by 2.<br>
<br>
<b>Comments</b><br>
<br>
Each Comment increases the Heat Index of the Zone, Post and the Blogger by 3. Heat Index decreases when the comment is deleted.<br>
<br>
Only the first comment by a given user on a given post alters the Heat Index. Subsequent comments have no impact on the Heat Index calculation.<br>
<br>
<b>Facebook Shares/ Comments</b><br>
<br>
When a post is shared or commented on Facebook, there is a possibility that the post receives additional Unique Views which increase the Heat Index.<br>
<br>
Facebook shares and comments are not directly included in the Heat Index calculation.<br>
