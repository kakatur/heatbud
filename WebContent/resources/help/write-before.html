<b>Ownership</b><br>

<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">A note on sharing:</span> Heatbud imposes no restrictions to share the posts in their "original" form giving due credit to the blogger. However, the content should NOT be extracted, copied or used elsewhere without obtaining permission from the blogger.<br>

<b>No Offensive Material</b><br>
<br>
Heatbud reserves the right to delete any material that has been considered inappropriate by us. Nudity and Violence are completely unacceptable on Heatbud.<br>
<br>
<b>Blog Post Title</b><br>
<br>
Title goes right into the URL and together they form critical piece of information for search engines.<br>
<br>
Though you are allowed to update the Title later, Heatbud recommends you finalize the Title "before" you start writing the post, because search engines prefer the pages with URL and title exactly the same.<br>
<br>
Please read <a href="/do/help/popular/seo">Search Engine Optimization</a> for more information.<br>
<br>
<b>Gather Images</b><br>
<br>
Images add color and flavor to your post and without them, your post looks bland. There are two ways to host your images.<br>
<br>
(1) Upload them to the <a style="font-size:1.2em" href="/user/images">Images</a> page on Heatbud.<br/>
(2) If the images exist somewhere else on the internet, insert the URLs directly into your posts.<br/>
<br>
Whether you host your images on Heatbud or use them from an internet location, they should not be deleted after they have been inserted into your posts. Doing so will result in your post displaying broken links.<br>
<br>
<b>Use Tablet?</b><br>
<br>
You can take pictures on the Tablet and upload them directly from the <a href="/user/images">Images</a> page.<br>
<br>
